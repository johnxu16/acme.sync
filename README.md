### ACME SYNC

TLDR

I've been used Traefik for a while as a ingress controller. It works like a charm.

However, one day one cloud providers send me a email

> Here are some free amount of cdn quota, do you wanna use them?

I think why not.

With cdn, domains are actually pointed to cdn addresses so I have to configure ssl in the cloud provider for keeping them safe as well.

I checked out how much money I should pay to buy a wildcard ssl certificate.

Cannot afford it ðŸ˜¢

Choose to extract the let's encrypt ssl certificate files in the Traefik and upload them into different cloud providers with their sdk.

##### What it does

1. Track acme.json
2. Extract cert && pem generated by traefik
3. Upload them into different cloud services providers

##### How to use it
